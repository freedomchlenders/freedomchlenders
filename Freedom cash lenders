Getting approved for a loan can sometimes feel like you’re competing in a beauty contest – one in which your credit and finances are being judged for how good they look. With a high enough credit score and lots of money in the bank, you could be crowned the winner of a gleaming new personal loan.

But what if your credit doesn’t look that great? Do all loans require a credit check?

These days lenders are becoming a lot more specialized in the kind of loans they make and the credit types they accept. Borrowers with bad credit, or those with a limited credit history, are finding it easier to qualify for a loan with no hard credit check.

Here are some things you should know and tips for improving your chances of landing a no-credit-check loan.
