When you have bad credit, every financial decision you make should be focused on increasing your credit score. Unfortunately, even something as necessary as applying for a loan can cause a hard credit check and a potential ding to your score. To avoid this credit score trap, you should only consider bad credit loans with no hard credit check when you’re in dire need of cash.

Not all bad credit loans are alike, and many lending networks have no-credit-check lenders that understand the plight of borrowers with poor credit. Using a lending network has the advantage of getting your application in front of dozens of potential lenders, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs.

And, when you’re considering a potential loan offer, you can find out ahead of time if it entails a hard credit check.
